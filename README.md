# Hospital-Management-System
ïƒ˜	In this project, I used to create database and tables for Doctors, Patients, Co- Workers in workbench through which Doctors have three parameters namely Name, Experience and Expertise in. Patients have also three parameters namely
Name, Age, Treatment they went for. Co Workers have also three parameters namely Name, Qualification and position they are working. If we made changes 
In the python input values it automatically reflects change also in the database
Table.
